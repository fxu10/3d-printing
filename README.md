## Bisection

This is intended to provide a suitable cut through the 3D volumes in order to ultimately pull the model apart.

## Dilation

In order to ensure physical fits, we will dilate anatomical pieces in order to use them as references for boolean operations. This will allow us to push back 
the contours of neighboring anatomy so that the two pieces can fit together well after printing.
